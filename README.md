# Image Captioning
  Deep Learning model to generate a caption for a given image. <br />
  See [report.pdf](https://github.com/ramprasadkillari/Image-Captioning/blob/master/report.pdf)

## Datasets:
  [Flickr 8k](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398) <br />
  Flickr 30k

## Usage:
  ```python
  cd Caption/
  python3 caption.py dog.jpg
  ```

## Note:  
  First time you use this model, Keras will download the model weights from the Internet, which are about 500 Megabytes. This may take a few minutes.
